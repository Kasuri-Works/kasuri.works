description: "A solo project from a developer trying to say something. This game is made of code, pixels, and everything I couldn't say in words."
summary: "A personal story of burnout, recovery, and the code I wrote for myself — one that never returns."

HelloWorld.GoodBye()

> “Hello World.” — the very first line of code I ever wrote.  
> “GoodBye()” — the function I silently called when the system had finally worn me down.

## 👋 Who am I?

I’m a programmer.  
And right now, I’m also a solo indie game developer.

This game is made by just one person — me.  
Design, code, art, writing — everything built slowly in quiet hours fueled by frustration, burnout, and a tiny spark of something I thought I had lost.

I used to love writing code.  
But somewhere along the way, I stopped writing for myself.

Now it’s for Jira, for managers, for interviewers, for KPI dashboards, for whatever counts as “professional growth.”

But I’ve realized something:  
It’s not that I stopped loving programming.  
It’s just been so long since I wrote anything for myself.

## 💬 Why make this game?

Because there are so many things I couldn’t say out loud.

“I’m trying my best, but I’m tired.”  
“I don’t want to study for another interview.”  
“My code is not for points or compliments in a PR comment — it’s because I used to believe code was a language of creation.”

This isn’t a story about success.  
It’s a story about moving from `Hello` to `GoodBye()`.

Not a failure — but an attempt to recover.

## 🎮 So what is this game?

It’s a pixel-art action platformer. It has a story.  
The protagonist is a programmer.  
That might be me. It might be you.

It’s not about saving the world. There’s no epic destiny.  
It’s just someone breaking down inside a system,  
and trying to find their way back to being human.

Or more precisely:

> It’s a single function I wrote for myself —  
> **one that never returns.**

## 🛠 Current status

The game is still in development.  
I’m working on the demo now.  
There’s no release date. No trailer. No hype.

But I’ll keep updating this blog — with progress, breakdowns, and maybe a few breakthroughs.

Slowly, and stubbornly, I keep going.

If you’ve ever felt like you weren’t a person anymore —  
just a process, a resource, a task in someone else’s system —

Then maybe this game is for you.

**HelloWorld.GoodBye()**  
It’s not a project. It’s a message.  
A quiet `GoodBye()` that never needs to explain itself.

Maybe it’s for you.  
Or maybe it’s for the version of me that’s still trapped in that system.
